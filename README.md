## Overview

The dataset contains order-level sales data including pizza types, sizes, prices, and timestamps. SQL was used for data exploration, analysis, and preparation. The refined data was then imported into Power BI to build an interactive dashboard highlighting key metrics and trends.

Key focus areas included:
- Writing SQL queries to uncover product and sales insights  
- Preparing and validating data before loading into Power BI  
- Visualizing trends in revenue, order volume, and customer preferences  
- Identifying top-performing products and sales periods  
- Developing a dashboard that supports business decisions

- Analyzed number of orders and pizzas sold across months and days of the week  

### 2. Time-Based Trends
- Tracked monthly sales growth using total revenue and number of orders  
- Analyzed order patterns by day of the week  

### 3. Product & Category Insights
- Ranked pizzas by both revenue and quantity  
- Compared category-wise performance (Classic, Chicken, Supreme, Veggie, etc.)  
- Analyzed pizza size preferences and their contribution to revenue  

### 4. Dashboard Design (Power BI)
- Developed an interactive Power BI dashboard using multiple visuals  
- Integrated slicers and filters for better user experience  
- Structured layout to support decision-making and quick insights
